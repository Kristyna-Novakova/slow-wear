# slow-wear

Final Czechitas Project. E-shop Slow Wear based on renting clothes. Its main goal is to effectively reduce tons of clothes that sit in our wardrobes and are worn once or never, to support sustainability and a responsible attitude towards the fashion industry.

Customers can choose any number of pieces of clothing, pay a fee and rent the items for a month in advance. After 30 days, they return the borrowed pieces and can repeat the whole process. This model allows them to always have an up-to-date and stylish wardrobe without having to invest in new pieces of clothing that would later go unused.

Various technologies and tools were used during the development of the project. The graphic tool Figma was used to create wireframes and prototypes, which allows visualization and sharing of designs. CSS and HTML were used for styling and formatting the website. The JavaScript library React was chosen as the main framework for development, providing an efficient and robust solution for user interface design. The Zustand library was used to manage the application state, which allows easy data management and synchronization. The Supabase platform was chosen to implement user login and order storage, which provides access to a cloud database and authentication services.
